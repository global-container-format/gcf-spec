# GCF - Global Container Format

The Global Container Format (GCF) is a container format for deployment and exchange of media resources especially meant for real-time applications. Its main purpose is to be linear and simple to parse while maintaining a feature-set oriented towards efficient runtime resource loading. It draws inspiration from both the [DDS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds-pguide) and [KTX](https://www.khronos.org/ktx/) file formats. The GCF format attempts to strike a balance between the two in terms of speed of development and flexibility.

**Format version**: 2.0.1

**Format stability: üß™ WIP - UNSTABLE üß™**

This repository contains both the spec and the reference C implementation.

## Vocabulary

|Name|Meaning
|----|----
|Implementation|Unless otherwise stated, this word refers to a piece of software intended to read and/or write GCF files.
|Reader|A piece of software intended to read GCF files.
|Writer|A piece of software intended to write GCF files.
|Container|The data, including any metadata, stored in a GCF file. A container is a collection of resources.
|Resource|An indivisible unit of data, along with its metadata, within the container.

## Container

The general structure of the format is:

* Header
* 1..n Resource

The header is immediately followed by `Resource Count` resources.
Within each resource and between any two consecutive resources, padding and reserved bytes should be set to `0`.

## Header

The container header consists of the following fields:

Name           | Format  | Description
---------------|---------|------------------------------------------
Magic          | uint32  | Format identifier
Resource Count | uint16  | Number of resources following the header
Flags          | uint16  | Container flags

The format identifier is the string `GC##` encoded as a single 32 bits unsigned integer,
where `##` is a double digit unsigned integer representing the version.

For GCF version 2, this is equal to the string "GC02", encoded as `0x32304347`.

Files can be stored both as big-endian and little-endian. File endianness can be determined
by inspecting the first byte of the file. For little-endian encoded files, the first byte
will always be `0x47` (the equivalent ASCII character code for the letter "G"). Conforming
read-only implementations are not required to support both byte orders, while read-write
implementations should.

### Container flags

Name           | Bit     | Description
---------------|--------:|------------------------------------------
Unpadded       | 0       | Enabled when there is no padding between resources

The `Unpadded` flag, when enabled, requires no padding to be present between any two consequent resources.

## Resources

Each resource consists of a descriptor and some associated content data. The resource descriptor has the following structure:

Name                   | Format     | Description
-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------
Type                   | uint32     | Type of resource contained
Format                 | uint32     | Data format
Content Size           | uint32     | Size of content data
Extension Size         | uint16     | Size of the extra fields
Supercompression Scheme| uint16     | Data supercompression scheme

The `Type` field is an enumeration specifying the type of resource this descriptor refers to.

The `Format` field is an enumeration specifying how to interpret the resource data. Valid values for this field depend on the resource type and are informational only. Format values are not directly used by reader implementations and an unknown format value must not generate an error. Supported values are listed in the [format table](./format.md). The format range between `[0x70000000-0xffffffff)` is available for private application use. Format `0xffffffff` is meant for testing.

`Content Size` specifies the size, in bytes, of the supercompressed content data following the descriptor, without accounting for padding since it's not part of the resource.

`Supercompression Scheme` defines a compression scheme used within the resource to compress the content data. What part of the content data is compressed, depends on the resource type.

The above is known as the *common descriptor* and is the same for every resource type. When required, resources may extend their descriptor by appending further fields, generating a *composite descriptor* made of the common descriptor as specified above, followed by the *extended descriptor*. When this happens, `Extension Size` is the size, in bytes of the extended descriptor.

Resource descriptor structures must be aligned on a 64 bits boundary. Padding must be added **after the resource content data** to ensure the next resource descriptor is properly aligned, unless the `Unpadded` flag is enabled. In this case, no padding must be placed between the resource content data and the next resource descriptor, thus ignoring the descriptor alignment requirement. The last resource does not require padding.

A resource must be skippable even if its type is unknown by advancing `Size + ExtensionSize` bytes past the end of the common descriptor and, if padding is enabled, aligning the new address to a 64 bits boundary.

### Resource Types

The following resource types are specified:

Type #      | Name                                               | Format
-----------:|----------------------------------------------------|:------:
0           | [Blob](resources/blob.md)                          | ‚ùå
1           | [Texture](resources/texture.md)                    | ‚úÖ
0xffffffff  | Test                                               | ‚úÖ

In the table above, the `Format` column specifies whether the format field is meaningful or should be set to `FORMAT_UNDEFINED (0)`.

The resource type range between `[0x70000000-0xffffffff)` is available for private application use. When reading resource descriptors, any resource having an unknown descriptor should be ignored.

The resource type `0xffffffff` is meant for testing. Applications should skip a resource with such type. Implementations may support only a subset of resource types.

### Supercompression Scheme

Scheme # | Name
--------:|------
0        | None
1        | [ZLIB](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1950)
2        | [DEFLATE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1951)
0xffff   | Test

When the `None` supercompression scheme is used, no data is compressed and the compressed size of the data equals
its uncompressed size.

The supercompression scheme range between `[0x7000-0xffff)` is available for private application use.

The supercompression scheme `0xffff` is meant for testing. Reader implementations may support only a subset of supercompression schemes but writer implementations should support all.
